# RoamingControl Xposed module
Tired of having the R icon in the notification bar instead of showing the connection speed? Do you have a mobile plan that allows you to use it in certain countries like you were at home? Do you want to enjoy roaming in certain countries/networks but don't want to allow roaming everywhere?
Then this app is for you.

This started as a personal project for something that I needed myself but decided to make it a proper app for everyone to enjoy.
What this app allows you to do is:

   * Allow national roaming on virtual networks (to get rid of the R icon when being home)
   * Force phone into roaming mode on domestic networks that aren't the home network.
   * Add on which specific networks you want to allow roaming
   * Add in which countries you want to allow roaming (this will allow roaming on all the networks in those countries)
   * Dual-SIM support with separate rules for both SIMs.

**What this app doesn't do is just hide the R icon and show the connection speed.
If you add your current network or country when being abroad, you are roaming and it is your own responsibility to keep your phonebill in check.**

## About
I'm releasing this project of mine as open source as I no longer have a device that I can continue testing on. The app was originally made for Android JellyBean so I'm surprised that it has still worked up to Android 10 with no or minimal changes.
